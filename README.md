A portfolio website is a dynamic online platform that acts as a personalized showcase for your professional journey. It serves as a digital gallery, resume, and gateway for potential employers, clients, or collaborators to learn more about you.
1) Resume: A clear and concise presentation of my professional background and qualifications.
2) Project Showcase: A dedicated section to visually present my past projects, highlighting my strengths and areas of expertise.
3) Skills & Expertise: A structured overview of my technical and non-technical skills, demonstrating my capabilities.
4) Contact Me: Multiple ways to connect, including an email address (consider obfuscating it with JavaScript), a user-friendly contact form, and social media links.
5) Responsive Design: The website adapts seamlessly across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) for optimal viewing.
